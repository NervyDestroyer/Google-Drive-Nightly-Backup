# Designed for use with Windows TaskScheduler or equivalent
#
# Will wait for G:/ drive to be mounted by the Google Drive Desktop application that is started
# via TaskScheduler or equivalent before starting.
#
# Will move files that have had their sync started to a datestamped SyncStarted_<DATETIME> folder
#
# Extra sync folders can be specified via extra_sync_folders.csv. These are lightweight folders
# meant to be sync'd every night (such as a LiveSplit splits folder for example) IF ONE OF THE FILES
# CHANGED. These are designed to have multple days worth of backups (up to the max num backups).
# If the max num days worth of backups is met, the oldest backup is deleted. The format of the csv is:
#   FolderToSync,OutputLocation,MaxBackups
#   ex: path/to/Splits,G:/Splits,10
#
# NOTE: File upload not guaranteed to be complete upon program exit, may take multiple nightly
# runs before the files are fully uploaded
